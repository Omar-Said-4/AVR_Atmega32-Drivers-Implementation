# AVR_Atmega32-Drivers-Implementation
### Basic `C` Implementation of `AVR Atmega 32` driver and some hardware components
## Drivers are distributed into two layers:
1. `MCAL` (Micro Controller Abstraction Layer): contains an implementation of the controller basic Peripherals.
2. `HAL` (Hardware Abstraction Layer): contains an implementation of some hardware components.
- There is a library layer `(LIB)` shared across the above two layers.
